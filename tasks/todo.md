# Missing Navigation Pages Analysis

## Problem
The navigation system references 8 missing PHP files that cause broken links throughout the website.

## Analysis Results
After searching the entire codebase, I found that NONE of the following files exist:

### Missing Files with References Found:
1. **equipment.php** - Referenced in 6 files (dashboard.php, index.php, navbar.php, footer.php)
2. **activities.php** - Referenced in 12+ files (dashboard.php, index.php, navbar.php, footer.php, services)
3. **contact.php** - Referenced in 8 files (about.php, index.php, navbar.php, footer.php, services)
4. **vision-mission.php** - Referenced in 3 files (about.php, index.php, navbar.php)
5. **strategic-position.php** - Referenced in 1 file (navbar.php)
6. **profile.php** - Referenced in 3 files (index.php, dashboard.php, navbar.php)
7. **my-bookings.php** - Referenced in 4 files (booking.php, dashboard.php, process-tracking.php, navbar.php)
8. **logout.php** - Referenced in 3 files (admin sidebar, navbar.php, index.php)

### Additional Missing File Found:
9. **my-activities.php** - Referenced in dashboard.php

## Criticality Assessment

### CRITICAL (High Impact on Navigation):
- **activities.php** - Most referenced (12+ times), core functionality
- **equipment.php** - Main navigation item, referenced 6 times
- **contact.php** - Essential for user communication, referenced 8 times
- **logout.php** - Security feature, breaks user session management

### IMPORTANT (Medium Impact):
- **my-bookings.php** - User dashboard functionality, referenced 4 times
- **profile.php** - User account management, referenced 3 times

### LOWER PRIORITY (Limited Impact):
- **vision-mission.php** - Company info, referenced 3 times
- **strategic-position.php** - Company info, referenced 1 time
- **my-activities.php** - User dashboard feature, referenced 1 time

## Todo List

### Phase 1: Critical Pages
- [ ] Create equipment.php (equipment catalog/listing page)
- [ ] Create activities.php (activities listing and detail page)
- [ ] Create contact.php (contact form and information page)
- [ ] Create logout.php (session termination and redirect)

### Phase 2: Important User Features
- [ ] Create my-bookings.php (user's booking history and management)
- [ ] Create profile.php (user profile management)

### Phase 3: Company Information Pages
- [ ] Create vision-mission.php (company vision and mission page)
- [ ] Create strategic-position.php (company strategic position page)
- [ ] Create my-activities.php (user's activity history)

### Phase 4: Testing and Verification
- [ ] Test all created pages for proper functionality
- [ ] Verify navigation links work correctly
- [ ] Check responsive design on all new pages
- [ ] Test user authentication and access controls

## Notes
- All files should be created in the `/public` directory to match existing structure
- Each page should follow the existing design patterns and include proper headers/footers
- Database integration will be needed for dynamic content (activities, equipment, bookings)
- Authentication checks should be implemented for user-specific pages (profile, my-bookings, my-activities)
